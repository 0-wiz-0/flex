This is flex, the fast lexical analyzer generator.

flex is a tool for generating scanners: programs which recognize
lexical patterns in text.

More information about flex as well as the latest official release of
flex can be found at:

http://flex.sourceforge.net/

Bug reports should be submitted using the SourceForge Bug Tracker
facilities which can be found from flex's SourceForge project page at:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/flex

There are several mailing lists available as well:

flex-announce@lists.sourceforge.net - where posts will be made
announcing new releases of flex.

flex-help@lists.sourceforge.net - where you can post questions about
using flex

flex-devel@lists.sourceforge.net - where you can discuss development of
flex itself

This file gives information regarding the cvs tree of flex. The cvs
tree of flex contains the files which are under version control by
the flex maintainers for the flex project. 

You can learn about the details of retrieving a copy of the cvs flex
tree from flex's SourceForge project page at:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/flex

If you are not interested in flex development or you are not in need
of the latest bleeding-edge features, then the cvs flex tree is
not for you.

When you get a distribution of flex, a large number of intermediate
files needed to make building flex easy are included. You don't have
that in the cvs tree.

You will need various external tools in order to build the distribution. Here is
a (hopefully complete and correct) list of the required tools. Always get the
latest version of each tool; we list the versions used in development of
flex, but the listed versions may not work for you.

compiler suite;  e.g., gcc
bash or some other fairly robust sh-style shell
GNU bison;  to generate parse.c from parse.y
GNU m4 1.4; required by GNU autoconf (yes, it *must* be GNU m4)
GNU autoconf 2.60 and GNU automake 1.10; for generating Makefiles etc.
GNU gettext 0.14.5; for i18n
flex (latest beta release);  for bootstrap of scan.l
help2man 1.36; to generate the flex man page
tar, gzip, etc.; for packaging of the source distribution
GNU texinfo 4.8;  to build and test the flex manual
perl; GNU automake and GNU autoconf now depend on perl to run
GNU indent 2.8; for indenting the flex source the way we want it done

Once you have all the necessary tools installed, life becomes
simple. To prepare the flex tree for building, run the script:

$ ./autogen.sh

in the top level of the flex source tree.
This script calls the various tools needed to get flex ready for the
GNU-style configure script to be able to work.

From this point on, building flex follows the usual configure, make,
make install routine.
